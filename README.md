## What is noDoom?

noDoom aggregates social media feeds in a limited manner to help prevent doomscrolling. Instead of endless scrolling, it provides a curated feed with a reasonable amount of posts on a 6 hour cooldown.

## Supported Platforms

- Bluesky
- Reddit (coming soon)

## Why no X/Facebook/Instagram integration?

Technical limitations make these platforms difficult to integrate:

- **X**: Free tier API is too limited for meaningful feed integration
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Meta's APIs are restrictive, making it impossible to fetch user posts without special access

I'm focusing on platforms that provide robust, developer-friendly APIs that allow me to deliver a reliable user experience while maintaining my core mission of promoting healthier social media consumption.
